# CommandCode Go/GOAT/Pro/Max CLIProxyAPI Plugin

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A native dynamic Go plugin for [CLIProxyAPI](https://help.router-for.me/plugin/development) that exposes a **CommandCode Go/GOAT/Pro/Max** plan as a single provider (`commandcode`; published model ids carry the `commandcode/` prefix).

The plugin owns model discovery, protocol translation, execution, key scheduling, and a quota page for the CommandCode account surface, so one API-key pool serves OpenAI, Anthropic, and Responses clients through CLIProxyAPI.

## What the upstream actually serves

CommandCode Go/GOAT/Pro/Max is reached through its OpenAI-compatible provider surface:

| Upstream route | Status |
|---|---|
| `POST {base-url}/chat/completions` | Serves the OSS models (`deepseek/*`, `z-ai/*`, `Qwen/*`, `MiniMaxAI/*`, `moonshotai/*`, …) |
| `GET {base-url}/models` | Model catalog |
| `POST {base-url}/messages` | Claude models only — OSS ids are rejected with *"Model … is not supported on this endpoint"* |
| `POST {base-url}/responses` | Not a registered route |

The default upstream base URL is `https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1`.

Because there is exactly one usable route for the catalog, **every model discovered from `/models` is routed to chat-completions by default**, whatever its family or vendor prefix. `route-overrides` exist for upstreams that really do serve another protocol on another endpoint.

## The Problem

Without this plugin, using a CommandCode Go/GOAT/Pro/Max plan in CLIProxyAPI requires hand-written provider blocks per protocol family, and the pieces that CLI clients depend on are missing or wrong:

- **Duplicated configuration & keys**: the same keys must be configured in several provider blocks.
- **Fragmented scheduling**: rotation, rate limits, and cooldowns cannot be shared, and the Management Center cannot show per-key usage.
- **Client protocol burden**: clients must know which upstream endpoint a model requires.
- **Lost reasoning**: CommandCode returns thinking text under `reasoning` / `reasoning_details[].text` (never the standard `reasoning_content`), so a plain OpenAI-compatible provider silently drops every chain-of-thought for Anthropic and Responses clients.
- **Rejected reasoning effort**: CommandCode's `/models` carries no thinking metadata, so a provider that validates `reasoning_effort` locally rejects `xhigh`/`max` even though the upstream accepts them.

## The Solution

- **Unified auth pool**: the plugin registers each configured key as a CLIProxyAPI auth record, so the host's scheduler handles rotation, retries, error cooldowns, session affinity, and per-key statistics.
- **Transparent translation & routing**: clients ask for `commandcode/<upstream-id>` and never need to know the upstream protocol.
- **Reasoning fidelity**: upstream thinking text is preserved for all three client formats, and `reasoning_effort` is forwarded verbatim when the model declares no capability.
- **One model catalog**: everything published by `{base-url}/models` is discoverable under the `commandcode/` prefix in `/v1/models`.

## Features

- **Single Provider Namespace**: models appear as `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`, `commandcode/z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`, … (prefix configurable, can be disabled for bare upstream ids).
- **Multi-Protocol Client Translation**: OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and OpenAI Responses requests all become upstream chat-completions calls, and responses are converted back — including streaming.
- **Reasoning Preservation**: upstream `reasoning`, `reasoning_details[].text`, and `reasoning_content` are normalized across targets:
  - Claude clients get a leading `thinking` block with `thinking_delta` events;
  - Responses clients get a leading `reasoning` output item with `response.reasoning_summary_*` events;
  - OpenAI clients get `reasoning_content` backfilled onto each chunk while the vendor fields stay intact.
- **Capability-aware Reasoning Controls**: an explicit `route-overrides` declaration (or catalog thinking metadata) re-enables eager validation and clamping; with nothing declared, the client's `reasoning_effort` is forwarded verbatim (`auto`/`none` omit the field) and the upstream is the authority.
- **Dynamic Catalog Discovery**: remote catalog with local fallback, deduplication, and diagnostics for what was excluded.
- **Native Credential Quota**: the plugin registers a quota provider, so every CommandCode credential shows its plan and 5-hour/weekly/monthly remaining quota inside the panel's own credential list — no plugin page and no panel extension needed, the way built-in codex/antigravity credentials appear.
- **CommandCode Quota Page**: a standalone Management Center page listing every configured credential with its account email, plan, remaining plan credits, and the rolling 5-hour/weekly windows (used, cap, reset time), refreshed per card on demand. It reads the management key from whichever panel is hosting it and falls back to a one-time prompt.
- **Multi-Key Auth Scheduling**: one key pool shared across all protocols through CLIProxyAPI's native scheduler.

## Requirements

- **CLIProxyAPI**: `v7.2.159+` (or any `v8.x`)
- **Go Toolchain**: Go 1.26+ (CGO enabled for `-buildmode=c-shared`)

## Build

```bash
# Linux (AMD64)
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugins/linux/amd64/commandcode-go-cliproxyapi.so .

# macOS (ARM64)
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugins/darwin/arm64/commandcode-go-cliproxyapi.dylib .

# Windows (AMD64)
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugins/windows/amd64/commandcode-go-cliproxyapi.dll .
```

Place the artifact into the host's plugin directory (e.g. `<cliproxyapi_root>/plugins/<os>/<arch>/`).

## Configuration

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  dir: /data/plugins
  configs:
    commandcode-go-cliproxyapi:
      # Upstream base URL (default: "https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1")
      base-url: "https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1"

      # Optional catalog override (default: "{base-url}/models")
      # catalog-url: "https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1/models"

      # Client-facing model id prefix
      model-prefix:
        enabled: true              # true -> "commandcode/<model>" (default: true)
        value: "commandcode"

      # CommandCode API keys (at least one required); supports ${ENV_VAR}
      api-keys:
        - value: "user_xxx"
        - value: "${COMMANDCODE_API_KEY}"

      # Catalog discovery
      catalog:
        refresh-interval: "15m"           # minimum "1m"
        stale-while-unavailable: true

      # Protocol switches: disabling one removes every model routed to it
      protocols:
        chat-completions: true
        messages: true
        responses: true

      # Per-model route pins; only needed when the upstream serves another
      # endpoint (CommandCode itself serves OSS models on chat-completions)
      route-overrides:
        "claude-sonnet-5":
          protocol: "messages"            # chat-completions | messages | responses
          endpoint: "/v1/messages"        # required, must start with "/"

      request-timeout: "5m"
      max-response-bytes: 67108864        # 64 MiB
      allow-http: false                   # http:// base-url for local testing
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api-keys` | `[]object` | *(Required)* | List of API keys (`- value: "..."`). Supports `${ENV_VAR}` expansion. Duplicates and empty values are rejected. |
| `base-url` | `string` | `https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1` | Upstream provider base URL. Valid HTTPS (or HTTP with `allow-http: true`), no query, fragment, or userinfo. |
| `catalog-url` | `string` | `{base-url}/models` | Catalog discovery URL. |
| `model-prefix.enabled` | `bool` | `true` | Client-facing ids use `<prefix>/<model>`; `false` publishes bare upstream ids. |
| `model-prefix.value` | `string` | `commandcode` | Provider prefix. |
| `catalog.refresh-interval` | `duration` | `15m` | Catalog polling cadence (minimum `1m`). |
| `catalog.stale-while-unavailable` | `bool` | `true` | Keep serving the last good snapshot when a refresh fails. |
| `protocols.*` | `bool` | `true` | Route kill switches. A disabled protocol excludes its models with a diagnostic. |
| `route-overrides` | `map` | `{}` | `{ model: { protocol, endpoint } }` pins a model onto another upstream route. `endpoint` is required. |
| `request-timeout` | `duration` | `5m` | Upstream HTTP timeout (also bounds account/quota calls to 30s). |
| `max-response-bytes` | `int64` | `67108864` | Maximum non-streaming response body size. |
| `allow-http` | `bool` | `false` | Permit `http://` upstreams for local testing. |

### Quota

The account surface lives on the same authority as `base-url`:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET {authority}/alpha/billing/credits` | Remaining plan credits and the 5-hour/weekly windows |
| `GET {authority}/alpha/billing/subscriptions` | Plan id/status |
| `GET {authority}/alpha/whoami?limits=1` | Account email for the card label |

`{authority}` is derived from `base-url` by trimming its provider path (`/provider/v1`).

**Native per-credential quota (recommended).** The plugin advertises a `quota_provider` capability: the panel lists each CommandCode credential with its plan and remaining quota next to the built-in codex/antigravity ones, refreshed from the credential row. Nothing to configure — install the plugin, and `POST /v0/management/plugins/commandcode-go-cliproxyapi/quota` answers per `auth_index`. The normalized response reports **remaining** fractions (`1.0` = untouched), and the raw remaining/purchased credit counts as summary metrics.

**Standalone quota page.** Panels without a plugin-quota view can still use Management Center → plugins → `CommandCode Quota`. The page is panel-agnostic: it recovers the management key from whichever panel's local storage holds it (`enc::v1::` for the official Management Center, `enc::v2::` for CPA-Manager-Plus, scoped `cli-proxy-auth*` entries, or plain JSON), and if none is readable — a panel that keeps the key in memory only, or one on another origin — it asks for the key once and remembers it for that tab. Either way each card is refreshed manually and independently; the page never polls, and quota values never influence routing.

### Reasoning effort

CommandCode publishes **no capability API**: `{base-url}/models` returns only `id`, `object`, `created`, `owned_by`, `name` and `context_length`, and its `/alpha/*` account surface has no models or capabilities route. The per-model effort lists that exist live inside the vendor's own clients (the `command-code` CLI and the web app both ship a static table), and the upstream gateway itself accepts every value in the union `low | medium | high | xhigh | max` regardless of the per-model list.

Consequences for this plugin:

- with nothing declared in the catalog, `reasoning_effort` is forwarded verbatim (`auto`/`none` omit the field) so `xhigh` and `max` work;
- if a catalog entry ever carries a `thinking` object (`levels`, `min`, `max`, `zero_allowed`, `dynamic_allowed`), that declaration takes over and eager validation plus budget clamping are re-enabled;
- the vendor's per-model table, the probes behind these statements and the evidence for the missing capability API are recorded in [`docs/model-capabilities.md`](docs/model-capabilities.md).

## Provenance

This plugin was built with reference to two prior CommandCode plugins:

- [opencode-go-cliproxyapi](https://github.com/massiveits/opencode-go-cliproxyapi) (v0.1.7) is the direct ancestor: the adapter kernel, catalog, config, auth, and quota scaffolding come from there, and the CommandCode-specific behaviour — reasoning preservation, unattributed-capability effort passthrough, the chat-completions-only route default, and the account API used by the quota page — was adapted on top.
- [cpa-plugin-commandcode](https://github.com/ahoo/cpa-plugin-commandcode) (ahoo) is an independent earlier CommandCode plugin whose write-up established the vendor behaviours this plugin had to reproduce: thinking text arriving under `reasoning` / `reasoning_details[].text` and never `reasoning_content`, the resulting need to backfill `reasoning_content` before CLIProxyAPI's openai→claude translator sees it, the SSE `data: ` prefix that streaming `/v1/messages` requires, and the fact that only fully-qualified vendor names (`deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`) are accepted upstream.
